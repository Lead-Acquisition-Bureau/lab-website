      <h1>Call Routing Optimization</h1>
      <p>LAB leverages powerful routing engines like Ringba and TrackDrive to ensure every inbound call is matched to the right buyer, at the right time, with the highest potential for conversion. Whether you’re routing to call centers, IVRs, or distributed agents, our team handles setup, logic, and monitoring.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>✓ Multi-layered filters by geo, time of day, buyer bid, or language</li>
        <li>✓ Waterfall routing for overflow and maximum monetization</li>
        <li>✓ Dedicated support for new buyer onboarding and test routing</li>
        <li>✓ Built-in failover logic and quality scoring by call outcome</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We turn routing into a performance advantage — driving more revenue per call and fewer wasted leads.</p>
